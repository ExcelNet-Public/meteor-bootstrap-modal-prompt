# bootstrap-modal-prompt

This [Atmosphere package](https://atmospherejs.com/theduke/bootstrap-modal-prompt) for [Meteor](http://meteor.com) makes it really easy to show a confirm dialog with custom content to the user, and get the result. You can also use a custom template for the content, and even specify a SimpleSchema to generate a form with AutoForm and get the form data in a callback.

## Installation

meter add theduke:bootstrap-modal-prompt
